"The image to modify is in RGB format.  Color precision can be float, double, "
"8, 16, 32, 64.  The green pixels are kept stationary, and you can shift the "
"red and blue colors within a range of {-10..+10} pixels.\n"
"\n"
"Lateral Chromatic Aberration is due to camera lens(es) with no aberration at "
"the lens center, and increasing gradually toward the edges of the image.\n"
"\n"
"Directional X and Y axis aberrations are a flat amount of aberration due to "
"image seen through something like glass, water, or another medium of "
"different density.  You can shift pixels up/left {-10..+10} down/right.\n"
"\n"
"Lateral aberration correction is applied first, since the lens(es) are "
"closest to the film or image sensor, and directional corrections applied "
"last since this is the furthest away from the camera."
